## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install a [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) server in a Debian or Ubuntu system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.8.8 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian or Ubuntu environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml) from GitHub:

```
- src: http://github.com/idealista/airflow-role.git
  scm: git
  version: 1.8.2
  name: airflow
```

or using [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/idealista/airflow-role/) as origin if you prefer:

```
- src: idealista.airflow-role
  version: 1.8.2
  name: airflow
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - { role: airflow }
```

## Usage

Look to the defaults properties file to see the possible configuration properties.

Bear in mind that, starting with Airflow v1.10.0, PyPi package `pyasn1` v0.4.4 is needed. To install it:
``` yml
airflow_required_python_packages:
  - {name: pyasn1, version: 0.4.4}
```

`airflow_extra_packages` (available at: https://airflow.apache.org/installation.html#extra-packages) should be a list following this format:
``` yml
airflow_extra_packages:
  - celery
  - mysql
```
## Testing

```
pipenv install -r test-requirements.txt --python 3.8
pipenv run molecule test
```
